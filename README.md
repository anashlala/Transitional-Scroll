# Transitional-Scroll
Developed an interactive landscape application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features dynamic movement of elements such as the sky, moon, mountains, and a boat in response to vertical scrolling (scrollY). It includes a transition between day and night, influenced by the moon's position within the scene.
